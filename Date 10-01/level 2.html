<p>The <strong>University of Lucknow</strong> (informally known as Lucknow University, and LU) is a public state university based in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Founded in 1867, the University of Lucknow is one of the oldest government owned institutions of higher education in India. LU's main campus is located at Badshah Bagh, <b>University Road area of the city with a second campus at Jankipuram</b> . It is the largest state university of Uttar Pradesh.

    LU is a teaching, residential and affiliating university, organized into 556 colleges and 17 institutes, located throughout the city and other surrounding areas. It is also one of the oldest residential universities of India. The University has jurisdiction over colleges in five districts: Lucknow, Raebareli, Hardoi, Sitapur and Lakhimpur Kheri.[3][better source needed] The university is opening a third campus in Sitapur district where vocational and skill development courses will be offered.[4]
    
    The University of Lucknow is the only state university of Uttar Pradesh to be awarded "Category-I" university status by the UGC for excellence in teaching and research. It is also the first public university in the State of Uttar Pradesh to be accredited with A++ status by the <i>National Assessment and Accreditation Council</i>.</p>
    <p>The idea of establishing a university at Lucknow was conceived by <b>Raja Sir Mohammad Ali Mohammad Khan</b>, <strong>Khan Bahadur</strong>, K.C.I.E. of Mahmudabad. He contributed an article in then popular newspaper, The Pioneer, urging the foundation of a university at Lucknow. Later Sir Harcourt Butler was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the United Provinces, and was also made Mohammad Khan's well-known interest in all matters, specially in educational matters. The first step to bring the university into being was taken when a General Committee of educationists and persons interested in university education appointed for the purpose, met in conference at Government House, Lucknow, on 10 November 1919. At this meeting Sir Harcourt Butler, being the chairman of the committee, outlined the proposed scheme for the new university.

        Eventually, The King George's Medical College (today's King George's Medical University), The Canning College, The Isabella Thoburn College provided structural as well as educational and <i>administrational help for the establishment of the university.</i></p>
